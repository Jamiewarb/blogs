### Personal Time meetings are short 30 to 45 minute meetings between a manager and a direct report.

It is time dedicated to the direct report, carved out of the manager's week. As such, the direct report should be setting
the agenda, bringing things they want to talk about. It's the direct report's chance to make sure they're getting
everything they need from their manager and the business.

It is specifically to talk about the direct report, their wellbeing and their problems. It is not a time to catch up on 
progress of tasks or anything unrelated to the direct report and their wellbeing.

### The goal of personal time, in a metaphorical sense, is to "identify fissures before they become cracks". 

For the direct report, this means when they feel problems may be starting to arise, the manager can help solve them before
they actually become problems.

For the manager, it's slightly harder - their role is to "tease out" problems that the direct report may not even know
they have. This is done through probing questions, talking through the direct report's thoughts and using some intuition.

## How to run Personal Time meetings

### The first meeting is important to set the tone

It's important to begin building trust in you as a leader, and the personal time meetings as a process, and that starts
from the very first meeting.

#### First off, explain what personal time is

Some people have never had personal time meetings, so it can be a new concept for them. Talking through the above 
description of what a Personal Time meeting is can be a great introduction for your direct report.

Alongside that, I ask them to "think of me as a benefit to you, provided by Hex, a bit like your laptop. I'm here to
make your life easier and your work better and faster. Use me to help you however I can."

#### Give the direct report their personal time document

I record agenda points, actions and notes in a shared document with the direct report. The [template of which can be found
here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QK9H0k_zP2kmJDQLiK3LBV8mQLmXMtIvsflJpPJqb1g/edit#). I find this is important
for a few reasons.

First of all, it helps your direct report build trust in you and the personal time meeting, by showing them what you're
doing for them, and hopefully showing that the meeting is useful. Second, it gives the direct report a place to throw 
thoughts into, under "Agenda", so that they can forget about them until the next personal time meeting.

It's also a record of the 1:1s, which is great to look back over during review cycle. Lastly, it helps you as a leader 
identify trends in how your direct reports are doing, such as those struggling in their roles, with their mental health 
or at home.

#### Discuss the personal time traditions

I also talk through a short list of personal time traditions (traditions not rules). I tell them that "I'm giving you
these traditions so that you can see what I do to give this time as much attention and respect that I can. I would hope
for the same from you as well." This helps set their expectations of me, and shows them mine of them, for personal time.

Lastly, I put these traditions at the bottom of their personal time document. This lets the direct report refer back to
them, and they're reminded of those traditions when they open the document.

As of writing, these traditions are:

>- I’m always gonna meet in a quiet place where I can give you full focus and so we can have confidential discussions if need be
>- I’ll always remove distractions, so I’m only gonna have two windows open, the first is Zoom and the second is our shared notes. I’m not going to be opening slack or checking email. I would expect that from you too.
>- We’ll always reschedule instead of skipping. Your personal time is important to me, so if you’re busy or I’m busy, we’ll always reschedule and make time for it.
>- I’ll always be prepared, having reviewed notes from our last 1:1s so that I can treat this time with the importance it deserves, and I hope you’ll be able to as well.
>- I’ll always be turning my camera on so you can see me, I find it a lot easier to have a meaningful conversation that way, and I’d appreciate it if you can too but I won’t expect it, so if you don’t want to, that’s absolutely fine.


### A loose structure guides through the meeting 

My loose structure typically goes:

- Check in / how are you feeling
- Recap on actions and notes
- Shared Agenda
- What sucks about work right now?
- What're you proud of?
- Vibe Check
- Anything else on your mind?
- Clarify actions and takeaways
- Self-Reflection on 1:1s (on my own)

Before the 1:1 begins, you should open the personal time doc and review the last session or two. This will get you into
the mindset for the meeting ready for when your direct report joins.

At the start of the 1:1, recap with your direct report on the previous 1:1. This should include recapping on actions
that either of you had: “I did this/I promised you this and I’m still working on it”.

Then we go through the shared agenda, talking about each point in turn. Notes and Actions are recorded during these
discussions. The manager is actively listening, trying to read between the lines and discover what threads need
pulling to uncover potential problems that the direct report may not have identifed themselves yet.

As we work a lot remotely now, I use a blunt "vibe check" to get a gauge on how the direct report is doing. This insight
is usually gleaned from seeing the person in the office and observing how they are interacting with others. As we're
remote, that's no longer possible, so the vibe check is a brute-force method of trying to get some of that information.
It's been really helpful, and helps with spotting trends in the employees feeling, and spotting potential flight risks.

A really useful question to ask during 1:1s is "is there anything else on your mind?". This can be asked as many
times as needed until the direct report no longer has anything else on their mind. It's a great question to access
what the employee may be thinking but not yet saying.

Lastly, we clarify actions and takeaways, ensuring they're clear and assigned to either the direct report or the manager. 
We also talk about timelines and expectations to make sure they're also clear.

Finally, after the 1:1, I take a few minutes to reflect on how it went. See the section on self-reflection below.

## Tips for the meeting

It's important that the personal meeting stays focused on the person, and not on their work. It's not the right time
to catch up on how their tasks are progressing or if they've done their quarterly reports, unless that is specifically
a reason they're struggling or aren't happy. **Focus on the person, not on the work.**

Ask "Is there anything else on your mind?". Keep asking it until there's nothing else on the direct report's mind.

There will be times when there is silence in the meeting, such as when you ask "is there anything else on your mind?". 
It's important to stay silent during this time, even if you feel the need to fill that silence. This silence is allowing
the direct report to think, which is an important part of their reflection process. Resist the urge to fill the silence.

## Self-reflection is important to keep improving your leadership

After each 1:1, take a few minutes to reflect on it. Play it back in your head and try to think about what was 
successful and what could be improved.

The following questions can be used while reflection to help measure the success of the meeting:

- Did they do most of the talking? 
- Were we aligned on the takeaways? 
- Did the direct report leave with a renewed sense of purpose and motivation? Did they leave feeling better or worse? 
- Did we come up with shared action items?
- Verify with other direct reports if what this direct report is saying is true and get other sides of the story (with respect to how they felt about situations)
  - I inherently trust that every emotion is valid, but people are talking about their perspectives, so my job is to provide other perspectives that they might not have 
  - Talk about the problems to find those other perspectives, and can circle back to the direct report and even explain those perspectives
